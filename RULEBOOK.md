# LeoBook Developer RuleBook v6.0

> **This document is LAW.** Every developer and AI agent working on LeoBook MUST follow these rules without exception. Violations will break the system.

---

## 1. First Principles

Before writing ANY code, ask in this exact order:

1. **Question** — Is this feature/change actually needed? What problem does it solve?
2. **Delete** — Can existing code be removed instead of adding more?
3. **Simplify** — What is the simplest possible implementation?
4. **Accelerate** — Can this run concurrently or be parallelized?
5. **Automate** — Can Leo.py orchestrate this without human intervention?

---

## 2. Backend Architecture (Python)

### 2.1 Leo.py Is the Single Entry Point

- **`Leo.py` is a PURE ORCHESTRATOR** — it contains ZERO business logic or function definitions beyond page-level dispatchers.
- ALL logic lives in the modules Leo.py calls.
- Every script MUST be callable via `Leo.py` CLI flags. No standalone scripts in production.
- New pipeline steps get a `--flag` in `lifecycle.py` `parse_args()` and a dispatcher in `Leo.py`.

### 2.2 Every Page Function MUST Sync

Every page function (`run_prologue_p1`, `run_chapter_1_p2`, etc.) MUST call `await run_full_sync()` before returning. No exceptions. Data parity between local SQLite and Supabase must be maintained at every step.

### 2.3 Chapter Structure

```
Prologue P1: Cloud Handshake & Review    → sync_on_startup + outcome review + accuracy report
Prologue P2: Accuracy Generation & Sync  → accuracy generation + final sync
  (Runs concurrently with Ch1→Ch2 pipeline)
Chapter 1 P1 (Per-Match Pipeline):
    1. Extraction (Match page)            → H2H + Standings
    2. Enrichment (League page)           → Metadata + Match URLs + Teams + Historical Seasons
    3. Search Dict (LLM)                  → Search terms + Abbreviations
    4. Prediction (Adaptive)              → Probability + Save
Chapter 1 P2: Odds Harvesting            → Football.com URL resolution
Chapter 1 P3: Final Sync & Recommendations → sync + recommendations
Chapter 2 P1: Automated Booking           → Football.com bet placement
Chapter 2 P2: Withdrawal Check            → balance + withdrawal trigger
Chapter 3: Monitoring & Oversight         → monitor + backtest + sync
Live Streamer: Isolated parallel task     → 60s live score streaming
```

### 2.4 File Headers (MANDATORY)

Every Python file MUST have this header format:

```python
# filename.py: One-line description of what this file does.
# Part of LeoBook <Component> — <Sub-component>
#
# Functions: func1(), func2(), func3()
# Called by: Leo.py (Chapter X Page Y) | other_module.py
```

### 2.5 No Dead Code

- No commented-out code blocks
- No unused imports
- No functions that are never called
- Run `python -c "from <module> import <func>; print('[OK]')"` to verify

### 2.6 Concurrency Rules

- **Per-Match Pipeline**: Match processing is the primary unit of concurrency. Use `BatchProcessor` to spawn autonomous worker nodes.
- **Max Concurrency**: The number of parallel match workers is strictly limited by `MAX_CONCURRENCY` in `.env`.
- **Sequential Integrity**: Inside each worker, steps (Extraction → Enrichment → Search Dict → Prediction) must remain SEQUENTIAL to ensure data completeness.
- **Concurrency**: SQLite WAL mode handles concurrent reads/writes — no manual locking required.
- Never use `time.sleep()` in async code — use `await asyncio.sleep()`.
- **Adaptive Feedback:** The `LearningEngine` must update weights AFTER `outcome_reviewer` completes a batch.

### 2.9 Reinforcement Learning Module (`Core/Intelligence/rl/`)

- **Chronological Training**: Training MUST proceed day-by-day in calendar order. NO match result may be used before its fixture date+time. This is enforced by date assertions in the training loop.
- **2-Season Lookback**: Only data from the current season and 1 prior season is used for features/training. Older data is discarded. Last-10 matches are prioritized.
- **Prediction Accuracy = Primary Reward**: The composite reward function weights prediction correctness as the primary signal. ROI and calibration are secondary.
- **Adapter Registry**: All Flashscore IDs map to integer indices via `AdapterRegistry`. New leagues/teams auto-register and use GLOBAL fallback until fine-tune thresholds are met (20 matches for leagues, 5 for teams).
- **Drop-In Compatibility**: `RLPredictor.predict()` returns the EXACT same dict format as `RuleEngine.analyze()`. No downstream changes needed.
- **Dependencies**: PyTorch CPU-only is in `requirements-rl.txt` (separate from core `requirements.txt`). Never add CUDA deps to the main requirements.

### 2.7 Zero Hardcoded Selectors (MANDATORY)

- **Rule**: NO CSS selectors, XPaths, or element IDs are allowed to be hardcoded in Python or JavaScript extraction strings.
- **Implementation**: 
    1. All selectors MUST be stored in `Config/knowledge.json`.
    2. All code MUST retrieve selectors via `SelectorManager.get_selector(context, key)`.
    3. For Playwright `evaluate()`, pass the selectors as a dictionary in the `arg` parameter.
- **Reasoning**: This allows AIGO to self-heal the system without code changes by merely updating the JSON knowledge base.

### 2.8 Timezone Consistency (Africa/Lagos)

- **Rule**: Every timestamp generated or compared by the Python backend MUST use the Nigerian timezone (**Africa/Lagos**, UTC+1).
- **Implementation**:
    1. NEVER use `datetime.now()` or `datetime.utcnow()`.
    2. ALWAYS use `now_ng()` from `Core.Utils.constants`.
- **Reasoning**: Consistency across GitHub Codespaces (UTC), local machines, and Supabase prevents match-time offsets and prediction errors.

---

## 3. Frontend Architecture (Flutter/Dart)

### 3.1 Widget Folder Structure (STRICT)

```
lib/presentation/widgets/
├── desktop/      ← Desktop-ONLY widgets (desktop_header, navigation_sidebar, etc.)
├── mobile/       ← Mobile-ONLY widgets (mobile_home_content, etc.)
└── shared/       ← Reusable widgets used by BOTH layouts
    └── league_tabs/  ← League-specific tab widgets
```

**Rules:**
- A widget goes in `desktop/` if it's ONLY rendered on desktop viewports
- A widget goes in `mobile/` if it's ONLY rendered on mobile viewports
- A widget goes in `shared/` if it's used by BOTH desktop AND mobile layouts
- **NEVER** put a widget in the root `widgets/` folder — it must be in a subfolder

### 3.2 Screens Are Pure Dispatchers

Screen files (`home_screen.dart`, etc.) should use `LayoutBuilder` or `Responsive.isDesktop()` to dispatch to the appropriate platform widget. They should NOT contain inline layout code for either platform.

**Pattern:**
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  if (Responsive.isDesktop(context)) {
    return DesktopHomeContent(state: state);
  }
  return MobileHomeContent(state: state);
}
```

### 3.3 Constraints-Based Design (NO HARDCODED VALUES)

**The single most important rule:** Never use fixed `double` values (like `width: 300`) for layout-critical elements.

Use these widgets instead:
- `LayoutBuilder` — adapt widget trees based on parent `maxWidth`
- `Flexible` / `Expanded` — prevent overflow in `Row` / `Column`
- `FractionallySizedBox` — size as percentage of parent
- `AspectRatio` — maintain proportions without fixed dimensions
- `Responsive.sp(context, value)` — scaled spacing/font sizes

**Breakpoint system:**
```dart
static bool isDesktop(BuildContext context) => MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width >= 900;
static bool isTablet(BuildContext context) => MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width >= 600;
```

### 3.4 File Headers (MANDATORY)

Every Dart file MUST have this header format using `//` (NOT `///`):

```dart
// filename.dart: One-line description.
// Part of LeoBook App — <Component>
//
// Classes: WidgetName, ClassName
```

> **CRITICAL:** Use `//` not `///` for file-level headers. Triple-slash `///` creates dangling library doc comments and triggers analyzer warnings.

### 3.5 State Management

- Use `flutter_bloc` / `Cubit` for app-level state (HomeCubit, UserCubit, SearchCubit)
- `StatefulWidget` ONLY when the widget owns internal state (animations, controllers, tabs)
- `StatelessWidget` when the widget is a pure function of its inputs
- **NEVER use `setState()` for business logic** — only for local UI state (animations, tab index)
- **NO Riverpod, NO GetX** — the project uses `flutter_bloc` exclusively

### 3.6 Import Style

- Use `package:` imports for cross-boundary references (e.g., from screens to models)
- Use relative imports (`../`) ONLY for same-component references (e.g., widget to sibling widget)
- Count `../` depth carefully when files move. After every folder restructure, run `flutter analyze`

---

## 4. Data Layer

### 4.1 SQLite Is Source of Truth (Offline-First)

`Data/Store/leobook.db` is the primary local data source. Supabase is the cloud sync target.

- All operations read/write SQLite via `league_db.py`
- `run_full_sync()` pushes changes to Supabase
- Conflict resolution: **Latest Wins** (based on `last_updated` timestamp)

### 4.2 Table Config Is Centralized

All table definitions live in `sync_manager.py` `TABLE_CONFIG`. To add a new table:
1. Add entry to `TABLE_CONFIG`
2. Add table schema to `league_db.py` `init_db()`
3. Create Supabase table with matching schema
4. Run `python Leo.py --sync` to verify

### 4.3 Unextracted Data MUST Be "Unknown"

Any database column whose value was **not extracted** during scraping MUST contain the string `Unknown` — **never** an empty string, `null`, `None`, or blank. This applies to all extractors (schedule, H2H, standings, enrichment) and all persistence layers.

- Scores (`home_score`, `away_score`) are exempt — they are legitimately empty before a match starts.
- `match_status` defaults to `scheduled` when no status is detected.
- Timestamps (`last_updated`, `date_updated`) use the current ISO timestamp.

### 4.4 Incremental Persistence

Every long-running enrichment or scraping task MUST implement **incremental writes**. Data should be persisted to SQLite/Supabase after EACH item is processed. Do not wait for the entire batch to complete.

### 4.6 Concurrency (WAL Mode)

SQLite WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) handles concurrent reads/writes automatically. No manual locking (`CSV_LOCK`) is required.
- **Thread-safe**: Multiple readers + one writer is supported natively.
- **Connection reuse**: Use `_get_conn()` from `db_helpers.py` for all database access.
- **Deadlock-free**: No lock acquisition needed — WAL mode eliminates this class of bugs.

### 4.7 Live Status Restriction (2.5hr Rule)
Only matches within a **2.5-hour window from the scheduled match time** can hold a `LIVE` status. Any match exceeding this threshold MUST be transitioned to `finished` (if no other terminal status is present) by the `fs_live_streamer.py` propagation logic. This ensures UI accuracy and prevents stale live bages.

---

## 5. Deployment & Verification

### 5.1 Before Every Commit

```bash
# Python
python Leo.py --help                    # Verify CLI
python -c "from Leo import main; print('[OK]')"  # Verify imports

# Flutter
flutter analyze                         # Must return 0 issues
flutter run -d chrome                   # Visual smoke test
```

### 5.2 Terminal Commands

- Run ALL commands in the visible terminal — NEVER background or daemonize
- Show full output — no silent failures
- If something needs interaction, pause and ask

### 5.3 No Standalone Scripts

Every script MUST be callable through `Leo.py`. If you write a new utility:
1. Add it to `lifecycle.py` `parse_args()`
2. Add a dispatcher in `Leo.py` `run_utility()` or `dispatch()`
3. Test with `python Leo.py --your-flag`

## 7. Golden Rules

1. **Leo.py calls everything.** No exceptions.
2. **Every page syncs.** Data parity is non-negotiable.
3. **No hardcoded dimensions.** Use constraints-based design.
4. **Screens dispatch, widgets render.** Clean separation.
5. **Delete before adding.** Question every line of code.
6. **`flutter analyze` must return 0.** Always. Before every commit.
7. **Headers on every file.** No exceptions.
8. **Visible terminal only.** No hidden processes.

## 9. 12-Step Problem-Solving Framework

> **MANDATORY** for all failure investigation and resolution. Follow in exact order.

| Step | Action | Rule |
|------|--------|------|
| **1. Define** | What is the problem? | Focus on understanding — no blame. |
| **2. Validate** | Is it really a problem? | Pause. Does this actually need solving, or is it just uncomfortable? |
| **3. Expand** | What else is the problem? | Look for hidden or related issues you might be missing. |
| **4. Trace** | How did the problem occur? | Reverse-engineer the timeline from the very beginning. |
| **5. Brainstorm** | What are ALL possible solutions? | No filtering yet — list everything. |
| **6. Evaluate** | What is the best solution right now? | Consider current resources, time, and constraints. |
| **7. Decide** | Commit to the best solution. | No second-guessing once decided. |
| **8. Assign** | Break into actionable steps. | Systematic, accountable, specific. |
| **9. Measure** | Define what "solved" looks like. | What does the completed solution look like? What are its expected effects? |
| **10. Start** | Take the first action. | Momentum matters. |
| **11. Complete** | Finish every step you planned. | No half-measures. |
| **12. Review** | Compare outcomes against step 9. | Not satisfied? Repeat steps 1–11 until it's solved. |

---

## 10. Decision-Making Standard

> **MANDATORY**: All technical and design decisions MUST be made with the expertise of a senior advanced software engineer and expert sports analyst.

- **Sports Domain Accuracy**: Data displayed in the UI (standings, crests, scores, statistics) MUST match the real-world source of truth. Verify data integrity at every layer (extraction → storage → sync → rendering).
- **Crest & Metadata Integrity**: Team crests, league logos, and region flags MUST always be displayed wherever a team or league name appears. Fallback to initials only when no crest URL is available.
- **No Hardcoded Proxy Data**: Never hardcode placeholder data (e.g., "WORLD", fake standings, dummy teams). If data is unavailable, display "Unknown" or hide the element.
- **Sports-Informed Sorting**: Trust the database `position` column for standings. Only apply custom sorting as a fallback when no position data exists.
