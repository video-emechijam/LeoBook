# trainer.py: PPO-based RL trainer with chronological training and composite reward.
# Part of LeoBook Core — Intelligence (RL Engine)
#
# Classes: RLTrainer
# Called by: Leo.py (--train-rl)

"""
RL Trainer Module
Handles offline training from historical fixtures (chronological, day-by-day)
and online updates from new prediction outcomes.

Training constraints:
- Strict chronological order (no future data leakage)
- Season-aware date selection: training starts from each league's actual season
  start date, not a global hardcoded date floor
- Last-10 matches prioritized via recency weighting
- Prediction accuracy is the primary reward signal

Season targeting (--train-season CLI flag):
  "current"     Use each league's current_season (from leagues table). Default.
  "all"         All available seasons, oldest-first. Use for a full cold retraining.
  N (int)       Past season by offset: 1 = most recent past, 2 = two seasons ago, etc.
                Matches the --season N convention used by enrich_leagues.
  "2024/2025"   Explicit season label (split-season format).
  "2025"        Explicit season label (calendar-year format).
